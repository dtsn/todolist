# Todo List App

Please find my Todo List app contained. It was built using Create React App so the commands are :

`npm start` and `npm run test` to run the example and run the tests.

We are saving the todolist via localStorage.

I've focused on the code more than the styling, deciding instead to spend my time writing unit test than
styling the app. For styling we are just importing Bootstrap which enables us to create a responsive application quickly.

## Features
- Add a todo
- Mark a todo as done
- Delete a todo
